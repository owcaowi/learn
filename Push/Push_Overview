How does it work?
-----------------
- On initial startup of your app, the FCM SDK generates a registration token for the client app instance. 
- The registration token may change when:
   -> The app deletes Instance ID
   -> The app is restored on a new device
   -> The user uninstalls/reinstall the app
   -> The user clears app data.
